Chino Salangsang</h1>

<p>
Hi My name is Chino Salangsang. I am a professional PUBG player for Action PH, I tend to do play for 12 hours a day or more if I have the free time, these days I can only do half of that and play on scrims during the night because I have to do schoolworks to maintain my grade in school. My family supports me in what I am doing today so they are okay if I tend to look at the screen for the whole day and will repeat the day after. On my spare time I try to get out of my room and spend time with my friends outside we would go eat together or go to there houses and stay and talk to each other. My goal in life is just to be happy and do what I love. By the time i reach 30 years old I want to have a stable income and own a business with my step-dad </p>
